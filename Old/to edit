 There sure is a problem: young students don't get enough education in schools about engineering. Sure, they have physics class, and one in a million school has 'science fairs', but that's all. But did you see any microcontrollers? Did you teacher show you how a transistor works? Did you blink a LED with an arduino or raspi in your programming class? Did they teach you to code anything useful? I just finished high school, and I haven't seen anything like that (inside school I mean, so I had to learn it all by myself). That's a serious problem. How can children be interested in engineering if they don't even see anything interesting? How can young students know how awesome it is to build and program something if they don't experience it? We need more practical education, and we need it cheap, because schools tend to not have too much money to buy any equipment. We have to make learning engineering fun and interesting instead of just teaching meaningless formulas and code snippets.
