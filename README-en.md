## Introduction:
<img src="Pictures/logo%20Cing.png">

Everybody knows [Lego](https://www.lego.com/en-us/) as an campany. They are making most popular [Lego](https://www.lego.com/en-us/) sets and robots ever. They have <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms">Lego NXT and Lego EV3</a> robot sets which are easy to program and build, but after you have learned how to program them with [Lego](https://www.lego.com/en-us/) software there isn't any other programing language. So  if you want to learn some other language you have to get something else for example [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is great platform because it is an open source, cheaper than [Lego](https://www.lego.com/en-us/) and you aren't that limited. But when you get arduino you will sooner or later realise, that you have to know how electronics works. And that's the point where most of people will give up.


<a href="https://github.com/Galeje/Cing" target= "_blank">Cing</a> solves this problem because it has a <a href="https://github.com/Galeje/ing/tree/master/libraries" target= "_blank">libraries</a> which allow users to easely program <a href="https://github.com/Galeje/Cing" target= "_blank">Cing</a> in C language without electronic knowleadge. We also created pdf <a href="https://github.com/Galeje/Cing/blob/master/CINGtlac.pdf">guide</a>  which teaches you the basics of programing <a href="https://github.com/Galeje/Cing" target= "_blank">Cing</a> robot. 

After learning the basics of programing with <a href="https://github.com/Galeje/ing/tree/master/libraries" target= "_blank">libraries</a> they can use <a href="https://github.com/Galeje/Cing" target= "_blank">Cing</a> robot as learning tool for electronics, because it has an open source design. That mean that they can program it with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) language or AVR language.
